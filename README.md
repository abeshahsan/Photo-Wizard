## Download packages

To create a virtual environment in your project folder:

```
python -m venv packages
.\packages\Scripts\activate
```
N.B: To run any python or pip command in your project, you will need to activate the virtual environment
But if you don't create an virtual environment, install them globally, then you can ignore this part.

To download necessary packages in a virtual environment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then to run it:
```
python -m main
```
